In my recent research Kukery has changed its essence and grew from a visual culturally intertwined image/topic into a space of inner expression. Kukeri gave me the liberty of exploring my freedoms, without the fear of being exposed. It gave me the inner protesting or loving voice. And you cannot say that this is my comfort zone - no! This is the 'place' where I feel free from restrictions, everything is allowed while being a Kuker, and I push it even further. For me there is this potential, importantly enhanced current condition that can and does shift, as a natural force, its character. There is not a constant condition in which we are set to live, we have luckily many. I underline this moment's conditions, and each specific Kuker brings its character forward to it. 
In Frank Mohr I have grown towards ultimate appreciation of distortions. As I already had many sympathies for broken or malfunctioning objects or events, or society.  
In relation to technology I started to perceive Kukeri as such: as a broken, unwanted, mischievous guest, wandering around or interfering with everything important as possible. 
Kukeri often becomes a band of experimental musicians, poets and artists themself. They have gained a strong identity that reveals a multitude of talents.
